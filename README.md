# Bibliography

The bibliography contains an relevant articles that we have found, or have been sent to us. 

# G4 runs

G4 runs contain the data from any G4 runs we do, as well as the log files to ensure the dat can be reproduced.

# Log/Reports

Just any notes we thought would be useful to make, hoverever these are now largely incorportated into Jupyter notebooks we have produced. 

# Jupyter Notebooks

These were initially ran locally, but after some initial 'PoC' GANs, we moved on to runnng them on Google Colab for some GPU power, coupled with the ease of running on this software.
