9.15am : We met with Stephen Haywood and he explained to us the what and why of the project. We are going to be providing a GAN to use instead of G4 since the latter is computationally expensive and impacts the research because of that.

Later on we researched about LAr-TPCs, what argon detectors are, the sources of background.
