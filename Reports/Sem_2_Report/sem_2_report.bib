	journal = {Journal of Physics G: Nuclear and Particle Physics},
	abstract = {The existence of dark matter as evidenced by numerous indirect observations is one of the most important indications that there must be physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. This article reviews the concepts of direct detection of dark matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles in ultra-sensitive detectors located in underground laboratories, discusses the expected signatures, detector concepts, and how the stringent low-background requirements are achieved. Finally, it summarizes the current status of the field and provides an outlook on the years to come.}

abstract = "Increasingly stringent limits from LHC searches for new physics, coupled with lack of convincing signals of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) in dark matter searches, have tightly constrained many realizations of the standard paradigm of thermally produced WIMPs as cold dark matter. In this article, we review more generally both thermally and non-thermally produced dark matter (DM). One may classify DM models into two broad categories: one involving bosonic coherent motion (BCM) and the other involving WIMPs. BCM and WIMP candidates need, respectively, some approximate global symmetries and almost exact discrete symmetries. Supersymmetric axion models are highly motivated since they emerge from compelling and elegant solutions to the two fine-tuning problems of the Standard Model: the strong CP problem and the gauge hierarchy problem. We review here non-thermal relics in a general setup, but we also pay particular attention to the rich cosmological properties of various aspects of mixed SUSY/axion dark matter candidates which can involve both WIMPs and BCM in an interwoven manner. We also review briefly a panoply of alternative thermal and non-thermal DM candidates."
